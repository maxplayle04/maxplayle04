Here is a couple of facts about me!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a [Discord Bot](https://maxplayledev.org/hangoutbot) called HangoutBot alongside a couple other developers and [Section136Callouts](https://maxplayledev.org/section136callouts) which is an LSPDFR Callout Package for the game Grand Theft Auto V.
- 🌱 I’m not currently learning anything! That said, I learn new things about existing skills every day, which is what I enjoy most about development!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything, I'm always looking for some cool projects to become apart of!
